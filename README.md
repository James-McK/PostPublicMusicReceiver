A server and [web component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) to display what music I'm currently listening to on my website.
Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/), `bun index.ts` is all that's needed to run it.

Meant to work with [the MusicBee plugin](https://github.com/James-McK/PostPublicMusicPlugin) I wrote, but will accept any data in the correct format and authentication header.
See <https://mck.is/blog/2024/small-projects-for-fun/> for more details.
